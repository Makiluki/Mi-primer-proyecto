# demo

A new Flutter project by MCMEdev.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

First we going to need to create a new Flutter project.
*Whit:*

    flutter create --help
  
* We can see a world of posivilitis to make our project.

**Our file is going to be like this:**

    flutter create --project-name donnut_app .
    
That "." is asumming that you alredy have created your dir a you´r in there , the tree is goig to look like; From here `/usr/your_usr/app_project/{here is where we going to put our donnut_app comand because we alredy created de app_project dir}` if you want to create a dir while your doing the bash code you must put:

    flutter create --project-name donnut_app name_dir
  
 **output:**

    pwd ´usr/your_usr/name_dir/donnut_app_data´

We put `data` because flutter create have a lot of dirs...

* Then we move to the lib dir in `./name_dir/lib`
* We paste all our lib content (icons, images, pages, tab, util)
* Then we go whit `cd ..` to `/name_dir/`
* There whe paste our `pubspec.yaml` for the project compatibilitis and dependencies
* ...

ahora todo esta en tus manos timmy, ya hice mi parte :*
